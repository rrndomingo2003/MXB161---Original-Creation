This is used for my final group assessment for MXB161 during my 1st Year - 1st Semester at QUT. Supposedly, it is done with a group of 5-6 people but due to unfortunate events,
another groupmate and I had to create this with just the two of us. Only use this for viewing and/or reference for an idea but do not PLAGIARISE!
